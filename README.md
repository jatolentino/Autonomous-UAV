# Autonomous UAV 

Based on my last research paper in 2021.

This work aims to use Machine learning to enhance the path tracking of UAV during flight. Prior to using the non-linear controllers, a set of references points (weight points) have been used in the inertial reference frame.

# Matlab/Octave simulation
As an initial approach to simulate the drone navigation, the softwares Octave/Matlab have been utilized to provide trajectories and compute the equations of the state-space model. Due to the high non-linearities of the plant, a combined control method has been tested and improved with Machine learning.  

The goal of this project is to control the autonomous navigation of a drone, making use of the equations that describe its attitude (orientation) and position, such as any user can upload a path from 3D trajectories.
