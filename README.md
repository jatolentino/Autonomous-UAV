# Autonomous UAV 

Based on my last research paper: "LPV-MPC control and self-tuning feedback gains for the trajectory tracking of a quadcopter UAV"

The goal of this project is to control the autonomous navigation of a drone, making use of the equations that describe its atitude and position an implenent a software and simulation environment that allows to test the performace when a Machine learning algorithm is added to the control system study.

# Matlab/Octave simulation
As an initial approach to simulate the drone navigation, the softwares Octave or Matlab have been utilized to provide trajectories and compute the equations of the state-space model. Due to the high non-linearities of the plant, a novel control method is yet to be tested and possibly compared against traditional control algorithms.  

In the clip below, we conducted two test to demostrate that indeed, ML can enhance the tracking, decreasing the overshoot at the very beginning of the test.
